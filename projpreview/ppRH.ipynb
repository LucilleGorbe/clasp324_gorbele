    "# Project Preview: Walking Barometer\n",
    "### Lucille Eva Gorbe\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal and Introduction\n",
    "In this experiment, I seek to examine the ability of the LPS22HB barometric\n",
    "pressure sensor on-board the Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense Rev1\n",
    "to accurately detect real-life differences in elevation under\n",
    "three conditions: the outdoor environment the barometer is in is below \n",
    "zero degrees Celsius; the barometer is being jostled consistently; the\n",
    "barometer is potentially exposed to wind. These conditions are the same\n",
    "present in the Project Preview: Roadway Humidity experiment, as the experiments\n",
    "were conducted simultaneously. This experiment also serves to verify recorded\n",
    "timings of the walking path and relate them to roadway position for the\n",
    "aforementioned Roadway Humidity experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Measurements were taken on Monday, December 15th from 5:26PM to \n",
    "5:XXPM. They reflect a walking path of Mosher-Jordan Hall\n",
    "(at approximately 280m elevation) following Washington Heights to the Nichol's\n",
    "Arboretum main entrance, then following E Medical Center Dr until reaching the\n",
    "staircase beside the UofM Health East Helipad, at approximately 255m elevation,\n",
    "and an eventual return to Mosher Jordan Hall following E Medical Center Dr in\n",
    "the opposite direction.\n",
    "Six measurements were taken per minute at a consistent 10 second interval.\n",
    "The long period for measurement cycles was selected due to the long timeline\n",
    "for the experiment and that the data would be stored on flash. While a higher\n",
    "frequency was possible, imprecise recordings of location while walking on the\n",
    "path at long time intervals also encourage more distinction between data\n",
    "points. Additionally, \n",
    "\n",
    "The humidity sensor was held in an open coat pocket to maximize air exchange \n",
    "and was powered by batteries in the same coat pocket. \n",
